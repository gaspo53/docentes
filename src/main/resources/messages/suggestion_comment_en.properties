comment.RuleWCAG2A003 = The tables  must use summary attribute. \
                        The objective of this technique is to provide a brief \
                        overview of how data has been organized into a table \
                        or a brief explanation of how to navigate the table. \
                        The summary attribute of the table element makes this \
                        information available to people who use screen readers; \
                        the information is not displayed visually.
                        
#RuleWCAG2_004
comment.RuleWCAG2A004 = Data tables must use <th> elements for each column header.                        
                 
#RuleWCAG2_005
comment.RuleWCAG2A005 = The content of summary (attribute or tag) must be unique in the document.

#RuleWCAG2_006
comment.RuleWCAG2A006 = Data tables must have an unique id for each <th> element, \
                        which is referenced by a correspondent <td>.
                        
#RuleWCAG2_007
comment.RuleWCAG2A007 = For complex data tables table ids must be unique.\
                        A good practice is to put a representative ID to the table's content.
                        
#RuleWCAG2_008
comment.RuleWCAG2A008 = Data tables must have a headers attribute in each <td> element of the body.\
                        Those headers references  a corresponding <th> with an ID attribute (ID = headers) 
                        
#RuleWCAG2_009
comment.RuleWCAG2A009 = The headers attribute of the <td> elements must be on the page.\
                        In other words, the headers attribute references an ID of a corresponding <th>
      
#RuleWCAG2_010
comment.RuleWCAG2A010 = The iframe elements must have a title attribute

#RuleWCAG2_011
comment.RuleWCAG2A011 = The title content must be unique

#RuleWCAG2_012
comment.RuleWCAG2A012 = Frames should not be hidden or empty.

#RuleWCAG2_013
comment.RuleWCAG2A013 = The <title> element must be present, and must have content.\
                        A page with no title means a misunderstanding content.

#RuleWCAG2_014
comment.RuleWCAG2A014 = Missing or empty H1 element

#RuleWCAG2_015
comment.RuleWCAG2A015 = <h1> element content should not come only from the alt text of an image

#RuleWCAG2_016
comment.RuleWCAG2A016 = <h1> should match a subset of the words in the title element

#RuleWCAG2_017
comment.RuleWCAG2A017 = The page should contain no more than two <h1> elements.

#RuleWCAG2_024
comment.RuleWCAG2A024 = Assuming that Rule 013 is passed, <title> element, despite not being blank, it is also mandatory\
                        for this element to have a maximum length of 60 chars.\
                        This restriction is based on the fact that <title> has to be self explanatory enough, and\
                        as brief as it can.  
                        
#RuleWCAG2_025
comment.RuleWCAG2A025 = Assuming that Rule 013 is passed, <title> element, despite not being blank, it is also mandatory\
                        for this element to have more than one word.\
                        This restriction is based on the fact that <title> has to be self explanatory enough.\
                        
#RuleWCAG2_026
comment.RuleWCAG2A026 =  Images that doesn't have a Presentation role (ARIA), \
                         must have an alternative text describing the meaning \
                         of the image.

#RuleWCAG2_027
comment.RuleWCAG2A027 =  An image file name may not be specified for valid alternative text. \

#RuleWCAG2_028
comment.RuleWCAG2A028 =  Images that doesn't have a Presentation role (ARIA), the alternative text attribute \
                         cannot be an exact match to any of the following words: image, picture, graph, photo. \
                         Text containing a any of these words is not valid alternative text for an image.

#RuleWCAG2_029
comment.RuleWCAG2A029 =  The alternative text of an image must have a length that is within a certain range. \
                                 
#RuleWCAG2_030
comment.RuleWCAG2A030 =  Make sure longdesc points to a legitimate alternative resource (e.g. an .html file).

#RuleWCAG2_031
comment.RuleWCAG2A031 = If an image has an alt or title attribute, it should not have a presentation role. \
                        ARIA role="presentation" technique is intended to hide an element from AT users. \
                        A classical example is presentation images. If you place role="presentation" on the image then it gets \
                        removed from accessible tree. Also this technique can be used to remove HTML table semantics, \
                        i.e. if role="presentation" is specified on HTML table then table structure is not exposed. \
                        ARIA role="presentation" is completely ignored if it's used on focusable element. That means the element isn't removed \
                        from accessible tree and its native semantic is exposed. \
                        For example, if you put this role on HTML button then it's revealed as normal HTML button to AT. \
                        This is reasonable because if the user focuses the button then focus doesn't get lost and screen reader announces something meaningful.

#RuleWCAG2_034
comment.RuleWCAG2A034 = Each page must have the lang attribute on its <html> element, \
                        otherwise a screen reader won't be able to speech the content in the appropriate language. 
                         
#RuleWCAG2_035
comment.RuleWCAG2A035 = Each page must have the lang attribute on its <html> element, \
                        and it must have a valid language code (es, en, it, etc.), \
                        otherwise a screen reader won't be able to speech the content in the appropriate language. 
                         
#RuleWCAG2_036
comment.RuleWCAG2A036 = You should never use <table> for positioning. Naturally, tables exist to show tabular data, \
                        and when a screen reader detects a table, it will try to parse the data inside.\
                        Yes, it takes time and some effort, but you should eliminate those tables and replace them with <div>.
                         
#RuleWCAG2_038
comment.RuleWCAG2A038 = A description of a link (text), must be four characters long. That's mean you have to be \
                        as expressive as you can with the description of the link. You can't say "Go" in a link, for example.
                         
#RuleWCAG2_040
comment.RuleWCAG2A040 = A description of a link (text), must be always the same for a particular href. \
                        For example, if the href points to "/piano_works", the text ALWAYS must be "Works for piano".
                         
#RuleWCAG2_042
comment.RuleWCAG2A042 = When a image is used as a link, it must be at least 16x16 size.\
                        If the image si smaller, it causes confusion to the user of the application.

#RuleWCAG2_043
comment.RuleWCAG2A043 = If a link includes an img element and text content, and the words in the alt attribute content of the \
                        img element match the words in the text content of the link, then the alt attribute content should be set to be empty.

#RuleWCAG2_044
comment.RuleWCAG2A044 = The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its \
                        programmatically determined link context, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general.

#RuleWCAG2_057
comment.RuleWCAG2A057 = Audio elements should not play automatically when document is loaded.
                       
#RuleWCAG2_059
comment.RuleWCAG2A059 = Focusable elements with MouseOver should also have OnFocus event handlers

#RuleWCAG2_060
comment.RuleWCAG2A060 = Focusable elements with MouseOut should also have OnBlur event handlers

#RuleWCAG2_061
comment.RuleWCAG2A061 = OnChange event handler should not be used with the select element

#RuleWCAG2_062
comment.RuleWCAG2A062 = OnChange event handler should not be used with the select element

#RuleWCAG2_063
comment.RuleWCAG2A063 = Onmousedown, onmouseup and onmousemove event handlers should have keyboard\
                        equivalents (keypress, keydown)

#RuleWCAG2_067
comment.RuleWCAG2A067 = Do not use the <font> element to style text

#RuleWCAG2_068
comment.RuleWCAG2A068 = The blink and marquee elements must not be used. Blinking and moving text \
                        are an accessibility problem for people with photosenstive epilepsy and visual \
                        impairments.

#RuleWCAG2_069
comment.RuleWCAG2A069 = Do not use the <b> element to style text

#RuleWCAG2_070
comment.RuleWCAG2A070 = Do not use the <i> element to style text

#RuleWCAG2_071
comment.RuleWCAG2A071 = Do not use the <u> element to style text

#RuleWCAG2_072
comment.RuleWCAG2A072 = Instructions and operation must be accessible and not depend on solely\
                        on color, size, location or sound

#RuleWCAG2_073
comment.RuleWCAG2A073 = The <legend> tag defines a caption for the <fieldset> element, which makes it more descriptive.\
                        Each fieldset must have a caption to provide a description of what it is displaying.

#RuleWCAG2_074
comment.RuleWCAG2A074 = The <label> tag defines a label for an <input> element, and does not render as anything special for the user. \
                        However, it provides a usability improvement for mouse users, because if the user clicks on the text within the <label> element, \
                        it toggles the control. It shouldn't have any input element, but a description text.

#RuleWCAG2_075
comment.RuleWCAG2A075 = Each input should be referenced by a label with a for attribute, being equal to the ID of the element. \
                        The for attribute specifies which form element a label is bound to.

#RuleWCAG2_076
comment.RuleWCAG2A076 = For inputs that are images, applies the same conditions as for an <img>; it must have an alt text.

#RuleWCAG2_077
comment.RuleWCAG2A077 = Input elements where type=[button|submit|reset] must have a value or title attribute, because they are not text. \
                        Despite an input to be an button, it has no text references where the screen reader can speech.

#RuleWCAG2_078
comment.RuleWCAG2A078 = Button elements must have content. That's because the action of the button has to be meaningful

#RuleWCAG2_079
comment.RuleWCAG2A079 = Each effective label (legend + label) should be unique. In other words, you can't repeat the same label text\
                        more than once, in a fieldset with a legend

#RuleWCAG2_080
comment.RuleWCAG2A080 = The <label> tag defines a label for an <input> element. So each label element must have text content.

#RuleWCAG2_081
comment.RuleWCAG2A081 = The <legend> tag defines a label for a <fieldset> element. So each legend element must have text content.

#RuleWCAG2_082
comment.RuleWCAG2A082 = If the title attribute is defined for an input, select, textarea or button element it must also contain content \
                        since it will be used by assistive technologies as part of the effective label for the form control.

#RuleWCAG2_083
comment.RuleWCAG2A083 = ID (%1$S) is not unique. If a form control has an id attribute its value must be unique on the page.

#RuleWCAG2_084
comment.RuleWCAG2A084 = Check aria properties and states to make sure they are associated with a valid role.\
                        A role value of null indicates no role attribute is present in (FF,Opera, Safari, Chrome).\
                        \\u2019\\u2019 value indicates the role is set to an empty string for all browsers except IE, which also returns \\u2019\\u2019.\
                        If no role attribute is present neither of these values allow for unsupported state to be tested.

#RuleWCAG2_085
comment.RuleWCAG2A085 = ARIA attributes have valid value

#RuleWCAG2_086
comment.RuleWCAG2A086 = ARIA ID references must be valid IDRefs

#RuleWCAG2_087
comment.RuleWCAG2A087 = Check to see that the role is valid (value must be a valid Role name) for the ARIA attribute used

#RuleWCAG2_091
comment.RuleWCAG2A091 = For each valid role, check that any required properties are not empty.

#RuleWCAG2_092
comment.RuleWCAG2A092 = Check to see that the role is valid (value must be a valid Role name).
